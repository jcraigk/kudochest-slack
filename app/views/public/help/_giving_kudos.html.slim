h2.subtitle.is-3 Giving Kudos

p There are several ways to give kudos in Slack:

br
p 1. In Slack chat, you can provide the name of a user, a group, a channel, or even "@everyone" and follow that by two plus signs. The #{App.app_name} bot must be present in the channel. For example, to give a kudo to @Lisa, you could enter "@Lisa++". To give a kudo to all users in the "general" channel, you could enter "#general++". Additionally, you may provide a quantity and a note, for example entering "@Lisa ++2 for your help today" would send 2 kudos to @Lisa with the note "for your help today".

br
p If your organization has Topics enabled, then you may also specify a Topic when giving kudos. Topics typically represent an organizational value or process. Each Topic can be invoked with a specific keyword after "++" such as "@Lisa++ leadership". Emoji may also be used to invoke topics. Use the "topics" command to see all the active Topics for your organization.

br
p 2. Similar to #1 above, use the emoji configured by your administrator after the name of a user, such as "@Lisa :fire:". If Topics are enabled, use the specific emoji for the Topic you want to invoke.

br
p 3. In Slack, you can give kudos to the author of a message by reacting to the message using a specific emoji. Use the "settings" and "topics" commands to see all available emoji.

br
p 4. In Slack, you can enter the command "/#{App.base_command}" by itself to open a modal dialog that provides user-assisted input for giving kudos. This works in any channel, even if the #{App.app_name} bot is not present.

br
p 5. In Slack, you can give a kudo to the author of a message by selecting "User ++" from the Action Menu (click "..." while hovering over the message). This works in any channel, even if the #{App.app_name} bot is not present.

br
p Note: you can undo your last kudos gift by using the "/#{App.base_command} undo" command soon after giving the kudos.
