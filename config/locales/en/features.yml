      give_plusplus:
        title: Give kudos with "++"
        icon: plus-square
        detail: Once KudoChest is installed in your chat workspace, any active user can send and receive kudos. Giving kudos is an official way of saying "thank you" for a job well done or to call out a special achievement. There are four ways to give kudos in Slack, including simply typing "++" after a user, group, or channel name in Slack.
      give_emoji:
        title: Give kudos with emoji
        icon: smile-wink
        detail: You may optionally configure KudoChest to recognize a special emoji to trigger kudos, whether issued inline or as a reaction. The icon and kudos quantity can be changed at any time by the administrator.
      give_modal:
        title: Give kudos with command
        icon: terminal
        detail: Users can easily give each other kudos by typing a simple command in Slack that opens a modal dialog. This dialog assists the user in selecting recipients and specifying other options. It's a great way to get a feel for how the system works before jumping into using "++" or emoji.
      levelup:
        title: Level progression
        icon: signal-alt
        detail: KudoChest provides meaningful and obtainable goals to all users by breaking down the kudos grind into smaller levels, similar to how role playing games work. The leveling curve can be set by the administrator to make it easier or harder to get to higher levels.
      bonus_kudos:
        title: Participation rewards
        icon: star
        detail: If a user gives kudos several days in a row, they activate a Giving Streak. Each day they extend their streak, they receive bonus kudos. This is one of several ways that gamification elements are used to improve user engagement.
      give_groups:
        title: Group/channel kudos
        icon: users
        detail: Kudo can be given to individual users, user groups, or entire channels via simple chat commands. When you specify a group or channel, all associated users will recieve kudos. The administrator can configure details of how this works.
      app_settings:
        title: Advanced configuration
        icon: cog
        detail: KudoChest provides copious options so that each team can customize the experience to fit their culture. For example, some organizations prefer limited kudos giving while others prefer unlimited. Some prefer inviting a bot to every channel to listen for "++" while others prefer a more private approach by using only the "/kudos" command. After logging in and installing KudoChest as a workspace owner, go to App Settings to view all options.
      moderation:
        title: Admin moderation
        icon: hammer-war
        detail: KudoChest provides full administrator control over kudos transactions including historical search/filtering and ability to destroy kudos in situations where a user wrote an offensive note or just made a mistake.
      notifications:
        title: Notification options
        icon: satellite-dish
        detail: Chatbot responses can be sent as replies, standard messages, direct messages, or combined in a unified log channel. Responses can also be completely silenced if desired. Individual users have control over their own notification options as well.
      web_profile:
        title: Web-based profiles
        icon: user
        detail: Every user immediately has access to slick web-based profiles they can share with other members of their team. Each profile includes a detailed overview of stats, a history graph, a contextual leaderboard, and other helpful visuals.
      responses:
        title: Text or GIF responses
        icon: image
        detail: When a user gives kudos, the bot can respond with a variety of text-based themes or by sending custom animated GIFs. The GIFs can enhance the fun for many teams, but may not be a fit for more formal cultures.
      loot_shop:
        title: Loot shop
        icon: store
        detail: Admins can setup real-world rewards such as pizza or movie tickets and allow users to claim the items based on the amount of kudos they have received. This makes kudos more meaningful and encourages team participation. A simple web-based claim system provides a means of automatically or manually fulfilling user rewards.
      data:
        title: Data ownership
        icon: database
        detail: Administrators can easily import and export data at any time using CSV files so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. Coming from another chatbot system? No problem, just import your kudos in seconds and keep all your users' pass progress.
      history:
        title: Detailed history
        icon: chart-area
        detail: As users send and receive kudos, each transaction is recorded along with all its details. These data provide the backing for attractive web-based profiles as well as graphical reports, wallboards, and other tools you can use to track kudos history either for yourself or across your entire organization.
      weekly_report:
        title: Weekly email digest
        icon: envelope
        detail: Each week, an email containing a summary of activity from the previous week can be sent to the administrator as well as to each individual user who opts in. This regular communication keeps folks engaged and informed.
      team_wallboard:
        title: Team wallboard
        icon: tv
        detail: In addition to web-based profiles, wallboards are provided so teams can track kudos activity in real-time in open public workspaces outside of the Slack client. Having this visual aid available in your workspace improves user engagement and can act as a great ice-breaking tool for welcoming new team members.
      bonus_calculator:
        title: Bonus calculator
        icon: calculator
        detail: A great way to assign monetary bonuses to your team is by allowing kudos distribution to act as a natural peer review system. KudoChest provides a Bonus Calculator tool that assists in calculating bonuses for each of your team members so you can take advantage of the collective feedback that's already in the system.
      help:
        title: Help when you need it
        icon: question-circle
        detail: In-chat and web-based help pages provide quick reference points for users to get up and running with the system quickly. Additionally, human support is just an email away.
